# Simple Web Scraping Example  
Author: Amin  

## About:

This project is a simple web scraping script I used to extract information on an Under Armor (UA) website. I used Selenium to create a CSV file containing a list of products from the men's section.  

The list consists of four columns. Links to products, the product name, the number of colour it comes in and the price of the product.  

In total, the list consists of 426 records of UA products.  

**Columns**: 

1. Link | HTML Link | String  
2. Item | Product Name | String  
3. Colours | Number of colour product comes in | Integer  
4. Price | Price of product | Float
